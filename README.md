# UDEMY-ANALYSIS-AND-PREDICTION-APP
Project introduction

The Udemy Course Analysis and Prediction project is an interactive data analysis and machine learning application built using Python, Streamlit, and various data science libraries. The project focuses on analyzing Udemy course data, visualizing trends, and developing a predictive model to determine whether a course on Udemy is paid or free based on its attributes.

##Installation

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Streamlit
You can install these dependencies using the following command:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn streamlit

##Usage
In this project, we start by loading and exploring a dataset containing information about Udemy courses. 
The code is organized into distinct sections to achieve different goals:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We delve into the dataset, performing data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualization.
This section showcases the distribution of course attributes, correlations, and insights into course popularity, levels, subjects, and more.

Data Visualization: The project employs various charts and graphs to visualize the distribution of courses,
the number of courses posted over the years, subjects' distribution, levels' distribution, and other key trends. 
These visualizations offer a clear understanding of Udemy's course landscape.

Course Price Prediction: A machine learning model (Logistic Regression) is trained to predict whether a course is paid or free based on attributes like the number of lectures, subject, level, number of subscribers, and number of reviews. Users can input course details to get instant predictions.

Streamlit App: 
The heart of the project is the Streamlit app. This web application allows users to interact with the data, explore visualizations,
and even predict the payment status of a course by inputting specific details. The app's user interface is designed for a seamless and intuitive experience.

##How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (specified in the requirements.txt file).
Run the Streamlit app using the command: streamlit run your_app_file.py.
Interact with the app to explore Udemy course trends and make payment predictions.


##Project Impact

Informed Decision-Making:
Learners can confidently choose courses that align with their budget and preferences.

Optimized Pricing Strategy: Course creators can make informed decisions on course pricing based on market trends and user engagement.

Insightful Analysis: Platform administrators can gain insights into course popularity, subject preferences, and user engagement.

Educational Research: Researchers can analyze the trends and correlations within the Udemy course dataset.
The Udemy Course Analysis and Prediction project bridges data science and online education, providing a valuable tool for learners, instructors, and platform administrators to optimize their experiences and strategies.
